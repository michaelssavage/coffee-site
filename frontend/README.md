# Coffee and Tee List - MVST challenge Frontend

This is a basic Next.js application. It includes Tailwind for styling, but feel free to use a styling library of choice (or pure CSS!). However, please refrain from using a full-fledged component library like MaterialUI or Bootstrap. We want you to show us your CSS skills! ðŸ˜Ž

Also, we've added some boilerplate code, but (please) feel free to make it your own.
