# MVST Challenge

## Feedback

This challenge was a medium-sized ticket. I thought it was great having everything set up and ready to go initially.

I enjoyed using Postgres DB, Nestjs, and the new app router in Next.js for the first time. I thought they had great documentation to help learn so they were a great choice.

I did not like using Tailwind and Yarn so I replaced those with SCSS and NPM. Tailwind seemed long winded to read after adding many classes.

### What would you improve if given more time?

There are a few things I'd like to improve on, especially completing the extra points.

I added some unit tests to the frontend and backend but did not cover all possible tests but I would aim for 90-100% coverage with more time. I added 1 e2e test to nestjs but again, I would like to add more.

Animating the splash screen would have been ideal and also SEO friendliness could be improved too. Deployment would have been the cherry on top but I did not get around to this. I added some small animations but these could be improved upon.

I'd like to add more validation for the form, like the number input accepting floating numbers.

### How was your experience doing this challenge?

This was an interesting challenge, I learned a lot of new skills that I'm proud to develop and showcase here. Initially, there were a lot of technologies to get used to but once I found my groove I enjoyed it.

This ate up a lot of my time. It was a week long task that I had to sacrifice time in other places for. I wanted to do well in this project, so I found the time and I ultimately think it was beneficial.
