# Coffee Site

This site was a coding interview challenge using PostgreSQL, Nest.js backend, and a Next.js frontend. 
I used SCSS for styling and I learned how to use Nest.js and the new app router in Next.js for the first time.

## Features
- On starting the backend, it will seed the coffee items for you.
- I created a form that appeared in a modal for creating new coffee items that saved to the backend.
- I added nice animations to the navbar as you scroll and animations for displaying the modal.
- I added a filter so that you could change between the different coffee types; Robusta and Arabic.

## Running The App

1. Run Docker Desktop
2. cd into the backend, and run `./scripts/start-dev-db.sh`.
3. Run nest.js with `npm start`
4. Run next.js with `npm run dev`
